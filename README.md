This repo will contain code for creating a Table-Augmented Generation Solution

What is the difference between RAG and TAG

Both Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Table-Augmented Generation (TAG) aim to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by grounding their responses in external data. However, they differ in the type of data they retrieve and how that data is used to augment the generation process

Here's a breakdown:

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):

Focus:

  + RAG primarily retrieves unstructured text data from external sources, such as documents, web pages, knowledge bases, or 
  databases.
  + It's designed to provide LLMs with relevant contextual information to improve the accuracy and relevance of their responses.
  
Process:

  + A user query triggers a retrieval process that searches for relevant documents or text snippets.
  + The retrieved text is then combined with the user query and fed into the LLM.
  + The LLM generates a response based on both the user query and the retrieved context.
    
Data Type:

  + Unstructured text.
    
Use Cases:

  + Question answering over large document repositories.
  + Generating summaries of articles or reports.
  + Creating conversational agents that can access and use up-to-date information.
    
Table-Augmented Generation (TAG):

Focus:

  + TAG specifically retrieves structured data from tables, such as those found in databases or spreadsheets.10
  + It aims to provide LLMs with precise and factual information that can be used to generate accurate and informative responses.

Process:

  + A user query triggers a retrieval process that searches for relevant tables and specific data within those tables.11
  + The retrieved table data is then transformed into a format that the LLM can understand and use.
  + The LLM generates a response based on both the user query and the retrieved table data.

Data Type:

  + Structured table data.

Use Cases:

  + Answering questions that require numerical or factual data from tables.13
  + Generating reports or summaries based on table data.14
  + Creating conversational agents that can access and use structured data.

Key Differences Summarized:

Data Source:

  + RAG: Unstructured text documents.
  + TAG: Structured table data.15

Data Format:

  + RAG: Text snippets.
  + TAG: Table rows and columns.16

Information Type:

  + RAG: contextual information, and broad knowledge.17
  + TAG: factual information, and precise values.

In essence:

  + RAG enhances LLMs with broad, textual context.18
  + TAG enhances LLMs with specific, factual data from tables.19

  Both techniques address the challenge of LLMs generating inaccurate or outdated information by grounding their responses in 
  external data. They simply use different forms of external data.
